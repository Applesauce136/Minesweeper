# Minesweeper

## Description

It's a minesweeper game, but in real life!

## Timeline

### During break: write a beta of the game.
* Store mine locations and player locations
* Show players approximately how far away the closest mine is; the farther that mine is, the more error in the approximation
* Let players "flag" certain coordinates as mined
* Might tell players whether or not a flag is accurate, but avoid trial and error
* If all mines have a nearby flag and no flags are far from mines, the players win!
* Stepping on a mine will make a player "out."  The player will still be able to see the coordinates of teammates and talk to them, though, so she can join another player.
* Players might have a map of the mined area, showing locations of players and flags.
* Voice chat?  Might take up a lot of bandwidth; could make players rely on other communications

### After break: peripheries-- user database, about and instruction pages, desktop/mobile interaction, etc
* A user database is a must!  Players should be able to log in and see games played, pending games, and things of that ilk.
* The user database could be extended to hold popular maps, common mined regions (Central Park, for example), and sharing stories.
* About and instruction pages are important too!  Might be one page.
* Desktop/mobile interaction-- one or several players might be "mission control--" they can see the map that might have been implemented above.  They would give the players their eye-in-the-sky, possibly balancing issues with too much information coming from the map.
* Versus mode?  Mine sweepers and mine planters
